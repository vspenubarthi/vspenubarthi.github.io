   <p>Mass. Academy, being a STEM school, has an intensive STEM program in which students complete an independent science fair project. In this course, our teacher, Ms. Curran, teaches us interesting and innovative brainstorming techniques and provides guidance in the entire process of doing a science fair project. My project this year is to create an emergency response application which provides radius-based aid to people in need. Many individuals who are isolated and require medical attention do not always receive it in time, as they nearest medical services might not be able to reach them quickly. In order to provide a solution to this problem, this application sends a distress message to friends of the user within a specified distance, and these people can tap the notification and get directions from their location to the location of the individual who needs help.

     <p>In December, Mass. Academy holds its December Fair, which is a mock science fair, in order for students to present their progress on their projects and get comfortable with presenting in front of judges. To aid our presentation, we had to create a science fair board which would contain visuals and other information which complemented our presentation. Here are the slides to my poster.</p>

   <p>After Mass. Academy students complete their preliminary research for their STEM project, they write their literature review, which is a summary of all the pertinent information that they have researched. The literature review is crucial to a successful project as it demonstrates that the student has credible research to back up their claims and methods. Here is my literature review. </p>

  	<p>We continued our STEM projects into January and I was able to collect promising results from my project. First, compared to its competitors, EmerSave had the greatest number of relevant features that are paramount to a successful emergency response application. Furthermore, it is the only hands-free emergency response application currently in existence, and its novel radius-based notification system had a 100% success rate in the trials performed within a certain distance.

  <p>Every year at Mass Academy, we have the privilege to partner with a facility called Seven Hills, which provides assistance to those who are differently abled, and work on engineering a device to help a certain client. This year, I was in a group with Piyusha Kundu, Annie Fan, and Dan Ramirez, and our project was to develop a product which would remind our client to take his walker with him when he is on the move. To accomplish this task, our group tried several different approaches. The first primary approach was the development of an accelerometer the client would wear which would remind him to get his walker when he stood up, but we quickly realized that this would be too heavy and impractical. We then started looking into two-device systems and received signal strength indicator (RSSI). We hoped that we could place one device on the walker and the other on the client, and the idea is that once the client got a certain distance away from the walker, he or she would be alerted to retrieve the walker. We tested this system using smartphones but realized that the client might not be too adept with smartphone technology, and then tried two Arduino’s with Bluetooth modules, but realized that the device was too fragile and easily broke apart. After numerous other models and lots of brainstorming, we settled on a model which consisted of one Raspberry Pi Zero W module communicating with a smartwatch, and when the distance between the two crossed the set threshold, the buzzer wired to the Raspberry Pi would buzz, alerting the client to retrieve their walker. More information as to how we built this can be found on the <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Walker-Proximity-Device" download>Instructables</a> page we developed. An image of our device can be found in the handout below.</p>
