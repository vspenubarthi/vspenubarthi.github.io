				<p>I am a 16-year-old Indian male (if you couldn’t tell from my name), who lives in up Shrewsbury, MA. I consider myself quite an outgoing individual who is not afraid to start up a random conversation just for the sake of talking. Two of my most favorite things in this world include moose and mint chocolate chip ice cream, so if you like either of those: congratulations, you are a winner. If you want to become a winner, you could go to <a href="https://www.uhlmansicecream.com/">Uhlman’s Ice Cream</a> in Westborough; their ice cream is, in my opinion, top notch. I have lived in Shrewsbury for the last 4 years and attended Shrewsbury High School before attending Mass. Academy. Before that, I spent most of my childhood growing up in Westborough, but I have lived in other states as well. </p>

				<p>I have always felt like the stereotype that people who are academically gifted are bad at sports, and vice versa, is completely wrong. I believe that regardless of age, gender, or ability, everybody should be actively involved in sports as it leads to a healthy life and teaches many lessons that cannot be found in a book. I have been playing soccer almost all my life, and I was on Shrewsbury High School’s Junior Varsity team before coming to Mass. Academy. Even though I no longer play soccer competitively, I still play for fun and engage in various other forms of physical activity as well. </p>

				<p>There are many things which I do for fun (Yes, I do have a life). In my free time at home, I often expand my knowledge of coding and math. Other than that, I love to watch movies and hang out with friends (Yes, I have those too) and play soccer. I also have musical experience, as I have been played string instruments for 8 years and have experience playing the viola, cello, and double bass. I have played in both orchestras and a jazz band. My most favorite pastime is exercising. I love to run in my free time and am often always physically active. One thing that I love to do with my family is taking road trips. Often, in autumn, my family and I go on a fall drive to look at the beautiful foliage of the trees. </p>
