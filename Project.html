   <p>Every year at Mass. Academy, we have the opportunity to work on a project called Apps for Good. In this project, we develop a mobile application as part of a group, and the goal is that this app addresses some problem in the world. I had the privilege of working with Akshay Gopinathan, Mary Barsoum, and Annie Fan on an Apps for Good project this year which attempted to address the issue of food wastage in America. <br><br>Every day, supermarkets waste a lot of food by throwing away produce that does not meet its quality standard. However, most of this food is still edible and only failed the quality check because of minor issues that most people would not be too concerned about. For example, many apples are thrown away by supermarkets each day just because they might have a small bruise or the apple is not shiny. At the same time, there are many food pantries around the world which lack all the food supplies to be able to provide food to everyone in their community who needs it. After observing both scenarios, our group decided to develop an Android application which connected supermarkets and food pantries so that supermarkets can donate any excess food that they have to local food pantries. <br><br>This application allows for individual grocery stores to sign up and post all the food that they are willing to donate on a database. Food pantries can then search this database for food items that they need, and they are then able to contact the grocery stores which have that food in excess. This way supermarkets no longer have to waste perfectly good food and food pantries have a steady source of donations so that nobody who visits a food pantry will ever be told that pantry does not have food to provide them. <br><br>The part of the process that was most important for our project was probably the screening portion of the application. We realized when we were starting the project that the project that we selected would be one that we would be working on for several months, so we wanted to ensure that the project we selected was one that we all believed in and one that truly made a difference in the world. After we all chose an idea we believed in, we then split up the tasks based upon our skill sets to maximize efficiency while working on the application. I was one of the primary programmers. We then used GitHub to collaborate in the building of the application and used Google Hangouts to stay in touch with each other constantly. This way, we were all up to date on the project. After we finished building the MVP portion of the application, we developed a <a href="Docs/SoftwareTestPlan.pdf" download> software test plan </a> to check various features of the application through unit testing so that when we eventually publish this application, it can be a safe, stable build that people everywhere will be able to use.</p>

  <p>Mass. Academy, being a STEM school, has an intensive STEM program in which students complete an independent science fair project. In this course, our teacher, Ms. Curran, teaches us interesting and innovative brainstorming techniques and provides guidance in the entire process of doing a science fair project. My project this year is to create an emergency response application which provides radius-based aid to people in need. Many individuals who are isolated and require medical attention do not always receive it in time, as they nearest medical services might not be able to reach them quickly. In order to provide a solution to this problem, this application sends a distress message to friends of the user within a specified distance, and these people can tap the notification and get directions from their location to the location of the individual who needs help.

  <p>Every year at Mass Academy, we have the privilege to partner with a facility called Seven Hills, which provides assistance to those who are differently abled, and work on engineering a device to help a certain client. This year, I was in a group with Piyusha Kundu, Annie Fan, and Dan Ramirez, and our project was to develop a product which would remind our client to take his walker with him when he is on the move. To accomplish this task, our group tried several different approaches. The first primary approach was the development of an accelerometer the client would wear which would remind him to get his walker when he stood up, but we quickly realized that this would be too heavy and impractical. We then started looking into two-device systems and received signal strength indicator (RSSI). We hoped that we could place one device on the walker and the other on the client, and the idea is that once the client got a certain distance away from the walker, he or she would be alerted to retrieve the walker. We tested this system using smartphones but realized that the client might not be too adept with smartphone technology, and then tried two Arduino’s with Bluetooth modules, but realized that the device was too fragile and easily broke apart. After numerous other models and lots of brainstorming, we settled on a model which consisted of one Raspberry Pi Zero W module communicating with a smartwatch, and when the distance between the two crossed the set threshold, the buzzer wired to the Raspberry Pi would buzz, alerting the client to retrieve their walker. More information as to how we built this can be found on the <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Walker-Proximity-Device" download>Instructables</a> page we developed. An image of our device can be found in the handout below.</p>

     <p>Every year, Mass. Academy students compete in a thirty-six-hour math modeling competition called the HiMCM. In this competition, students form groups of four and have a choice between two real-world problems. They then must select one and attempt to find a solution using mathematics. This year, my group solved a problem in which the mayor of a city wished to put on a drone show and wanted advice on the best way to do it. We chose this problem because we felt that it would be easier to create a comprehensive model for this than to plot out skiing paths, which was the other challenge. To solve this problem, our group decided to simulate the different configurations of drones using a computer algorithm, and we generated various images which could be created from our display of drones. In the end, we presented the mayor two different options based on budget, with each option minimizing cost or maximizing the number of drones used. Overall, it was a great experience getting to work with three of my friends to tackle this problem. Read our paper below to see our solution. </p>
