     <p>It has been said that computers are the future of the world, and the Computer Science course helps us prepare to be leaders in this world. In this course, we are taught how to program in Java, but the primary goal of the class is to teach students how to develop a software product individually or as part of a team. Moreover, we also learn how to develop mobile applications, and take part in events such as Apps for Good, which is a project where we create an application to help people. We also compete in ACSL, which is a competition based on computer science principals. </p>

   <p>Every year at Mass. Academy, we have the opportunity to work on a project called Apps for Good. In this project, we develop a mobile application as part of a group, and the goal is that this app addresses some problem in the world. I had the privilege of working with Akshay Gopinathan, Mary Barsoum, and Annie Fan on an Apps for Good project this year which attempted to address the issue of food wastage in America. <br><br>Every day, supermarkets waste a lot of food by throwing away produce that does not meet its quality standard. However, most of this food is still edible and only failed the quality check because of minor issues that most people would not be too concerned about. For example, many apples are thrown away by supermarkets each day just because they might have a small bruise or the apple is not shiny. At the same time, there are many food pantries around the world which lack all the food supplies to be able to provide food to everyone in their community who needs it. After observing both scenarios, our group decided to develop an Android application which connected supermarkets and food pantries so that supermarkets can donate any excess food that they have to local food pantries. <br><br>This application allows for individual grocery stores to sign up and post all the food that they are willing to donate on a database. Food pantries can then search this database for food items that they need, and they are then able to contact the grocery stores which have that food in excess. This way supermarkets no longer have to waste perfectly good food and food pantries have a steady source of donations so that nobody who visits a food pantry will ever be told that pantry does not have food to provide them. <br><br>The part of the process that was most important for our project was probably the screening portion of the application. We realized when we were starting the project that the project that we selected would be one that we would be working on for several months, so we wanted to ensure that the project we selected was one that we all believed in and one that truly made a difference in the world. After we all chose an idea we believed in, we then split up the tasks based upon our skill sets to maximize efficiency while working on the application. I was one of the primary programmers. We then used GitHub to collaborate in the building of the application and used Google Hangouts to stay in touch with each other constantly. This way, we were all up to date on the project. After we finished building the MVP portion of the application, we developed a <a href="Docs/SoftwareTestPlan.pdf" download> software test plan </a> to check various features of the application through unit testing so that when we eventually publish this application, it can be a safe, stable build that people everywhere will be able to use.</p>
