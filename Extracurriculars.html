				<p> I have done several science fairs before and they have also been a huge learning experience. Not only did I gain knowledge of the subject I studied, but I was also able to get the hang of the engineering and design process. One of my most recent science fair projects was a cooking one in which I tested how different sugars affected the process of fermentation which occurs in bread. I made it to the <a href="http://scifair.com/">Massachusetts State Science Fair</a> for this. Most recently, last year, I created a filter with chemicals inside it which would be placed on the end of a car’s tailpipe. Then, as carbon dioxide passed through the tailpipe, it would react with the chemical inside the filter and be captured in a solid form, reducing excessing carbon dioxide emissions. I made it to the Massachusetts State Science Fair for this as well. </p>

				<h2>Robotics</h2>

				<p>Robotics has been a huge part of my life, as it is not only a demanding field at the moment, but it is also one of the few fields where you would need to combine a lot of different fields of expertise to get the job done. I joined my first FRC (First Robotics Competition) team during my freshman year, and it was Shrewsbury High School’s team: Team 467. From the cultural dinner nights to the long hours of build season, freshman season was definitely hard work, but we were able to make it to the New England District Championship. As sophomore year came along, I was selected to become a team engineering lead, which means that I would be responsible for the different aspects of our robot coming together within our deadline. With more than 80 students on the team this year, twice the size it was the year before, it was a huge learning experience. Currently, I am part of the WPI/Mass Academy team: Team 190.
